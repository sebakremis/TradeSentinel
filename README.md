# TradeSentinel
## 📌 Overview
`TradeSentinel` is a Python-powered stock screener, providing portfolio simulations for insights into PnL, exposure, and risk metrics.  

This project was created as part of my practice for the **Master in Data Science, Big Data & Business Analytics** at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.  
It also arises from a personal need to build my own **advanced stock screener**, since I was not fully satisfied with the existing tools available in the market.

## 📌 Disclaimer
This project was developed strictly for **academic and educational purposes**.  
It is intended to demonstrate portfolio analytics, risk metrics, and visualization techniques in Python.  

⚠️ **Important:** TradeSentinel does **not** provide financial advice, investment recommendations, or trading guidance.  
Any outputs, simulations, or metrics generated by this tool should be treated as illustrative examples only.  
Users are solely responsible for any decisions made based on the information produced by this project.

## 🚀 Features
- **Live market data:** Fetches prices from APIs (Yahoo Finance).

- **PnL tracking:** Calculates mark-to-market PnL by instrument, sector, or portfolio.  
   * Note: For historical data, `TradeSentinel` uses adjusted close prices (via auto_adjust=True) to account for dividends and splits. This ensures that PnL calculations reflect total return and avoids artificial price drops on dividend dates.    

- **Risk metrics:** Computes Value-at-Risk (VaR), exposure by asset class, and limit breaches.

- **Interactive dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for intuitive visualization.

- **Followed tickers (current implementation):**  
   The app currently uses a **fixed list of S&P 500 tickers** with a **Sharpe ratio greater than 1** over the past one‑year period.  
   This design ensures a consistent dataset for portfolio analysis.  

- **Future enhancement:**  
   Users will be able to **customize their own list of tickers**.  
   Before enabling this feature, the database logic will be redesigned to support dynamic ticker selection.

## 🛠 Tech stack
- **Python:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `altair`, `streamlit`, `plotly`
- **Data APIs:** `Yahoo Finance`
- **Deployment:** `Streamlit Community Cloud`

## 📈 Example use case
- **Intraday PnL tracking**: Monitor live portfolio PnL and key metrics during market hours to quickly spot drawdowns or performance spikes.
- **Comprehensive portfolio analysis**: View and explore portfolio metrics and visualizations over a selected time horizon. Analyze historical performance, sector allocation, and asset distribution trends to support medium‑ and long‑term investment decisions.
- **On-demand CSV snapshots**: Export the current portfolio metrics view to CSV for quick sharing, further analysis, or archiving as a daily snapshot.
- **Foundation for scalable financial platforms**: Use `TradeSentinel`’s modular architecture as the starting point for building more complex solutions — for example, integrating with broker APIs for live order execution, adding multi‑asset risk engines, or connecting to internal data warehouses for firm‑wide exposure reporting. Its clean separation between data ingestion, analytics, and visualization makes it easy to extend into a full‑scale portfolio management or risk monitoring system.
